=============
As I try to figure out macs as used at my new work, I'll try to save methods of mapping features from ubuntu to mac.

It doesn't seem to be one-to-one copyable.

.profile
-------------
.profile is mac's equivalent to bashrc. In ubuntu this is where colors for ls and grep are activated. Copy the contents of .profile and copy into ~/.profile, preferably without destructing the pre-existing content.
