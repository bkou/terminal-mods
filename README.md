terminal-mods
=============
As I try to figure out macs as used at my new work, I'll try to save methods of mapping terminal features from ubuntu to mac.

It doesn't seem to be one-to-one copyable.

.profile
-------------
.profile is mac's equivalent to bashrc. In ubuntu this is where colors for ls and grep are activated. Copy into a mac .bashrc equivalent, ~/.profile is probably the best. Be sure not to destroy content already in those files.

Features:
 * ll, la, l
 * ls and grep colors
 * can add a space to not leave something in history
